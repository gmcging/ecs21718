     My first project is about the social activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali. This was practice of background color, italicizing, <BR> beak lines, and other basic components of a website. This includes facts about Ayaan Hirsi Ali.

     <h3><a href="https://gmcging.github.io/ecs21718/HTML/FavoriteAnimal3">Favorite Animal 3</a></h3>
      This last project prior to this one includes slightly more complex html codes. It's labeled 3, beause I had done 2 <BR> other more basic versions of this website. This one includes facts and a <BR> carousel slideshow of picture of anteaters as well as a working navbar.
