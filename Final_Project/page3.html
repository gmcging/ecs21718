<center><h2>My name is Grace McGing. I am 15 years old and I go to Lane Tech High School. I like to play volleyball and run track. <br> 
I plan to try out for both next school year. I like school, and my favorite subject is math.
<br> Some of my hobbies include playing sports like volleyball and track. I also love to watch movies and T.V. shows on Netflix like the <br> 
The Office and Arrested Development. I also like art and plan on taking an art class as my elective next year. When I grow up, i sort of want <br>
to be an architect, but I'm exactly sure if that is what I really want to do. I alos love to travel. I've been to a couple of states, but <br>
every year I travel to Ireland since I have family over there. My dad is actually an immigrant from Ireland. I hope to travel more parts of the world. <br>
Some places I would like to go are France, Germany, Jamaica (My parents went and said it was amazing), Denmark, England, Italy, Hawaii, and Alaska <br>
(my dad recently went to see the Iditarod and said it was stunning). I'm also interested in photography. I love to take picture, and <br>
 my dad recently lent me his professional camera so now I can take professional pitcures. </h2></center>
